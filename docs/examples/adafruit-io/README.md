# Using Adafruit IO with WoTT Credentials

(https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-adafruit-io)

## Introduction

[Adafruit IO](https://io.adafruit.com) is a free cloud service interested in making IoT accessible to everyone through presenting data in a useful and user-friendly way. Services that they provide include linking your IoT devices to Twitter and weather services. We're interested in Adafruit as it also provides messages through an MQTT service via an API. We can therefore interact with Adafruit's services and use our WoTT provided credentials to secure it.

The first thing you will need to do, is to [sign up](https://accounts.adafruit.com/users/sign_up) for Adafruit IO so you can access their [dashboard](https://io.adafruit.com/). Familiarise yourself with their (basic guides)[https://learn.adafruit.com/series/adafruit-io-basics]. For this example, we'll need to create a Feed.
